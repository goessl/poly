# poly

A native polynomial Python module.
```python
>>> from poly import polyval
>>> from fractions import Fraction
>>> p = (Fraction(1, 2), Fraction(3, 4))
>>> x = Fraction(5, 6)
>>> polyval(p, x)
Fraction(9, 8)
```

## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/goessl/poly.git
```

## Usage

This package provides functions, similar to the ones found in `numpy.polynomial.polynomial`, but in pure Python.
This means it can handle Pythons native unlimited `int`s, `Fraction`s and every object that implements the needed scalar arithmetic without `numpy`s lossy conversion.

To represent polynomials sequences like `list`s and `tuple`s are used (coefficients in ascending order). The results are always returned as `tuple`s. The arguments are consumed but not altered.
The functions signatures try to mimic `numpy.polynomial.polynomial`, most often with less parameters because of less functionality.
Operations that are associative, like `polyadd` and `polymul`, allow arbitrary many arguments, even none.

If actual `polyzero`s (`()`, not some untrimmed polynomial like `(0,)`) are passed as arguments, the functions also correctly return actual `polyzero`s (`()`) or `polyone`s (`(1,)`).
The user is responsible to `polytrim` arguments and results.

Provided are fundamental polynomials:
 - `polyzero`: $0$,
 - `polyone`: $1$,
 - `polyx`: $x$,
 - `polymono(n, c=1)`: $c\cdot x^n$;

evaluation:
 - `polyval(p, x)`: $p(x)$,
 - `polycom(p, q)`: $p(q)$;

arithmetic operations:
 - `polyadd(*ps)`: $p_0 + p_1 + \dots$,
 - `polysub(p, q)`: $p - q$,
 - `polymul(*ps)`: $p_0 \cdot p_1 \cdot \dots$,
 - `polydiv(n, d)`: `(q, r)` such that $n=qd+r$,
 - `polypow(p, n)`: $p^n$;

calculus:
 - `polyder(p)`: $p'$,
 - `polyint(p, c=0)`: $\int p(x)dx$
